# Grim Pack #

This is the combined mods previously known as Grims Mods.

These are seperated into 7 parts.

Core, Cuisine, Decor, Industry, Tools, Util, and World

Core is what all of the sub parts rely on.
Cuisine is foody stuff.
Decor is for decorating and making everything look nice.
Industry is more technical blocks mostly.
Tools is tools and weapons.
Util is utilities like FusRoDah.
World is for world gen and entities.

=======================================

Since all of these mods used to be completely separate from each other please report any bugs or issues you find.

Also I am looking for ideas. Since this was pretty much a combination of the mods in their previous state they probably won't go together that well. 
For 1.9 I am going to try and get all of them interacting and fitting together.
So, if you have any ideas or thoughts send me a message or open an issue.
